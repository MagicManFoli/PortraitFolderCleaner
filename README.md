# PortraitFolderCleaner

This tool is used to clean up the folder structure created by Portrait Mode. 

1. Empty folders will be deleted
2. folders with portrait/clear photos will be deleted after the portrait photo has been moved to the parent directory.

Result will be a flat directory without subfolders.

Usage:
  PFC.py [ --path]

If no path was specified a prompt will be displayed.

**Use at your own risk!**

This will probably only apply to owners of Google Pixel smartphones.
