# PortraitFolderCleaner

This tool is used to clean up the folder structure created by Portrait Mode. 

1. Empty folders will be deleted
2. folders with portrait/clear photos will be deleted after the portrait photo has been moved to the parent directory.

Use at your own risk!

This will probably only apply to owners of Google Pixel smartphones.
